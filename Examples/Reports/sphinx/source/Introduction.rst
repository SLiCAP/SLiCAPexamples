Combining `SLiCAP <https://github.com/SLiCAP/SLiCAP_python>`_ with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ is a powerful method for writing electronic circuit design documentation websites while doing the design work. Each time, before before compilation, figures, tables, graphs, expressions and equations generated by SLiCAP, are automatically updated and imported in the ReStucturedText (*Sphinx*) source.

This document briefly describes the way of working. The main document is `sphinx/source/index.rst`; the path is relative to the SLiCAP project folder. The SLiCAP (Python) source code imported by this document is generated by `rstReport.py`; in the SLiCAP project folder.

.. _Project file locations:

Project file locations
======================

The project file locations are set and can be altered in the **[projectpaths]** section of the `SLiCAP.ini <../../../SLiCAP.ini>`_ file in the SLiCAP project folder. Below the listing of **[projectpaths]** section for this project:

.. literalinclude:: ../../SLiCAP.ini
    :linenos:
    :lines: 47-62
    :lineno-start: 47

Below the relevant paths for making SLiCAP HTML reports with Spihnx. *All paths are relative to the project folder.*

- `cir`: path to circuit netlist files, e.g. netlist files generated with `makeCircuit()`
- `csv`: path to `.csv` files, e.g. `.csv` files generated with `specs2csv()`
- `img`: path to image files: `.svg`, `.png`, `gif`, etc., e.g. generated with plot instructions and with `makeCircuit()`
- `sphinx`: path to the Sphinx make files. 

  The ReStructuredText source files and the Sphinx configuration file are located in the `sphinx/source/` subfolder.
  
- `rst_snippets`: path to RST snippets generated by the rst formatter
- `project`: SLiCAP python project folder

Sphinx configuration for SLiCAP
===============================

The Sphinx configuration file `conf.py <../../../sphinx/source/conf.py>`_ is shown below. You can adapt it to your needs.

.. literalinclude:: conf.py
    :linenos:
    :language: Python
    
Create Sphinx output
====================
    
SLiCAP lets you create Sphinx output in two ways:

- Create images and code listings with SLiCAP functions

  The generation and inclusion of images and code listings be discussed in section :ref:`SLiCAP output`.

- Use the SLiCAP RST formatter to produce ReStructuredText snippets

  The generation and inclusion of ReStructuredText snippets using the formatter will be discussed in section :ref:`Formatter methods`.
